# Chirpy Reverie 3DS
## Info
A 3DS *remaster* of Chirpy Reverie from Scratch in C++.<br>
This is a *remaster* of Chirpy Reverie, which was made by The Updator.<br>
The special thing about this remaster is that the original game was written in [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu).<br>
For people who don't know, Scratch isn't a real coding language and instead a visual block language.<br>
So that meant that I had to translate the Scratch code into C++ code.<br>
I used [libctru](https://github.com/devkitPro/libctru), [libcwav](https://github.com/PabloMK7/libcwav), [citro3d](https://github.com/devkitPro/citro3d) and [citro2d](https://github.com/devkitPro/citro2d) libraries for the *remaster*.<br>
## Building
For building you need to install the [devkitARM toolchains](https://www.3dbrew.org/wiki/Setting_up_Development_Environment).<br>
You also need to install libctru, libcwav, citro3d and citro2d on your system.<br>
Get the Makefile from this repo and run it, for Windows you probably need [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).<br>
